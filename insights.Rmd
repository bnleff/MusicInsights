First, we need tidyverse to handle data importing and wrangling...

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")
```

```{r}
#Useful Functions for Data Exploration

#nrow(df)
#colnames(df)
#levels(df)
```

```{r}
nrow(preferences)
```

```{r}
colnames(survey)
```

# Cleaning Data Fram Column Names

```{r}
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "generator_name"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?" ] <- "pseudonym"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Academic Year" ] <- "academic_year"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Sex"] <- "sex"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Major"] <- "major"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Year you were born (YYYY)"] <- "birth_year"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Which musical instruments/talents do you play? (Select all that apply)"] <- "instruments"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Timestamp"] <- "timestamp"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Artist"] <- "artist"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Song"] <- "song"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Link to song (on Youtube or Vimeo)"] <- "song_link"
```
